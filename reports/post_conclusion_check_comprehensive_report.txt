## Introduction

The Nintendo Gamecube, released in 2001, was Nintendo's fourth major home video game console and a successor to the Nintendo 64. It was a part of the sixth generation of video game consoles and competed with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox. Despite its relatively short lifespan and commercial underperformance compared to its rivals, the Gamecube garnered a dedicated following and is widely regarded for its impressive game library and innovative features.

## Hardware Specifications

### CPU

The Gamecube was powered by an IBM "Gekko" PowerPC 750CXe-based CPU, clocked at 486 MHz. It was a single-core processor with a 64-bit architecture and a six-layer, copper-wire process on a 180 nm die size of 43 mm². The CPU had a shorter pipeline compared to its predecessors, which improved its performance and efficiency.

### GPU

#### GPU Architecture and Pipeline

The graphics processing unit (GPU) of the Gamecube was developed by ATI and codenamed "Flipper." It was a relatively large chip with a die area of 120 mm² and 51 million transistors. The Flipper GPU featured 4 pixel shaders and 1 vertex shader, capable of rendering 6 to 12 million polygons per second. It supported a maximum resolution of 640x480 pixels (or 768x576 pixels in PAL mode) with a 24-bit color depth, allowing for up to 16.7 million colors.

The Flipper GPU had a fixed Texture Environment (TEV) stage in its pipeline, which was different from the more flexible pixel shaders found in modern GPUs. The pipeline design of the Flipper GPU involved pumping data through various stages to draw a frame on the screen.

#### GPU Memory

The Flipper GPU had an embedded 2 MB (4 x 512 KB) Z-buffer/framebuffer RAM with a 384-bit bus width (4 buses, each 96-bit wide) and a bandwidth of 7.8 GB/s. It also had an approximately 1 MB texture cache with a sustainable latency of 6.2 ns (1T-SRAM) and a texture read bandwidth of 10.4 GB/s (peak).

### RAM

The Gamecube had a total of 43 MB of non-unified RAM, divided into the following:

- 24 MB (2x 12 MB) MoSys 1T-SRAM @ 324 MHz (codenamed "Splash") as main system RAM
- 3 MB embedded 1T-SRAM cache within the "Flipper" GPU (2 MB framebuffer/Z-buffer, 1 MB texture cache)
- 16 MB of DRAM as an I/O buffer RAM

The system RAM had a 64-bit memory bus width, while the internal GPU memory had a 896-bit bus width, and the ARAM had an 8-bit bus width. The Gamecube's memory bandwidth was lower compared to its contemporaries, which could potentially be a bottleneck for certain applications.
